When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repository when collaborating with others or when using multiple computers to work on one project. It's also a good way to backup your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Have to be sure the changes are worth sharing. Other people will see what is pushed to GitHub. Must be important.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks = a new version of a respository on GitHub that is copied to your account so you can edit it without requiring permission.
Clones = a copy of the repository on your local computer
Branches = a new direction for the file, made locally on computer, not visible on GitHub
