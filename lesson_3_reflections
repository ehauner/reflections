When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repository when collaborating with others or when using multiple computers to work on one project. It's also a good way to backup your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Have to be sure the changes are worth sharing. Other people will see what is pushed to GitHub. Must be important.
