Initializing a repository creates a .git file in the directory and the log has zero commits

git init
git add
git status
staging area
working directory

staging area is a buffer space where files are added before being commited to the repository
the working directory is the directory where the files in the repositry are located

Use the staging area to have one commit per logical change by commiting only those files that are different from the file in the repository (?)

Branches = labels for commits

Merging = combining 2 commits

git branch

Adding new branches helps when you want to create a new mode of the game, experiment with a new functionality, etc without irreversibly breaking the original file. Whenever fixing a new bug or adding a new feature.

git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name

Both above can be accomplised together:
git checkout -b new_branch_name

Branch diagrams help us see how the commits are related and how/if they are reachable from each other

Merging two branches together chains all the commits together
